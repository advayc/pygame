Electric cars offer numerous safety advantages compared to traditional vehicles. 
Firstly, they significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents by eliminating human error from driving. 
Additionally, self-driving cars can mitigate the risk of drunk driving, as the vehicle handles all 
driving tasks autonomously. 
However, there are some safety concerns, such as the potential for hacking and data leaks.
