Ethics of Self-Driving Cars
One of the biggest ethical concerns about self driving cars revolves around the decision making. 
Most accidents are caused by human error, but with self-driving cars, how will they make decisions
in those moments? 
Manufacturers also need to make sure that there is no bias in the decision making system. 
Another question is who is liable in an accident, is it the owner of the car or is it the 
manufacturer of the car. 
Another big concern people have is the possibility of taking people's jobs. 
Ethically speaking self driving is more accessible especially with people who may have a disability.
