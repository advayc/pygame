Self-driving cars represent the future of transportation for several key reasons. 
First and foremost, they promise to make our roads much safer by removing human error and enabling 
communication between vehicles to prevent accidents. 
Additionally, many self-driving cars are electric, which makes them more environmentally friendly 
compared to traditional gas-powered cars. 
Furthermore, these vehicles can provide mobility to individuals who might not be able to drive 
otherwise, such as those who are blind or have certain disabilities.
